<h1>Quake Live</h1>
<p>Quake Live should work out well. Buy the game and you are all set. Maps download very fast from the server. Customizing the game is a lot easier than with Quake 3 Arena. No fancy commands needed to customize skins, FOV, picmip, etc. Make changes in the GUI.</p>
<p>Q3A is not compatible  with QL. You must purchase Quake Live on Steam.</p>
<p>If for some reason QL doesn't work out, let's switch to Q3A on Saturday. I can share out Q3A if needed.</p>

<h1>Steam Refunds</h1>
<p>If you are unsure about QL. Give it a quick try. Steam's return policy is flexible if you decide quick enough.</p>
<p>The Steam refund offer, within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of playtime, applies to games and software applications on the Steam store. Here is an overview of how refunds work with other types of purchases.
